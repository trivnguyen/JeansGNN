JeansGNN: Neural Simulation-based Inference with GNN for Jeans Modeling
==================================================

JeansGNN is a neural simulation-based inference framework for Jeans modeling based on Nguyen et al. (2023) [1]_. You can also find our paper on arXiv at `https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12825`.


The framework is built on top of the `PyTorch Geometric <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `PyTorch Lightning <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library.


Installation
------------

To install JeansGNN, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

Usage
-----

Currently, you may find the training tutorial at `tutorials/example_training.ipynb`.
The rest of the tutorials are under construction.

Documentation
-------------

Under construction.
